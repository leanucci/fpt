Welcome to Futbol Stats source code. Futbol Stats is my first Ruby on Rails project.

### The Basics ###

The whole site idea is simple: periodical release of statistics for teams and matches in the main Argentinian Soccer League (Primera divisi&oacute;n de la [Asociasi&oacute;n de F&uacute;bol Argentino][id])
[id]: http://www.afa.org.ar "AFA website"

It consists in two areas: management area, where teams, tournaments, standings and matches are created and maintained, and the public area, where all the information on teams, matches and tournaments is shown, along with the stats for a team.

### Standigns ###

The standings will be winning streaks, home and away win ratios, scoring ratios (for a start).
